# Introduction
The Hunt is a job searching tool that searches multiple career-oriented websites in order to aggregate many jobs onto a single web page.

# Installation
## Python Packages
Use the included requirements.txt to install the required packages through pip, like so:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Google API Key
This application requires the addition of a Google Maps API Key (details can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)). 

Once the API key is obtained, paste it into API_KEY.txt and it will be used.


# Usage
Launch the program by running app.py in the root directory of the repository with Python 3.
 
```bash
python app.py
```
A browser window should then automatically open and show the application.

Input the desired search terms, city, and maximum distance. Then, click "Find a Job Now" to view the results.
